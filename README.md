The data set focused on fish species in the North Temperate Lakes. For this statistical testing, trout perch was the only species to be focused on. 

The question asked was if trout perch length can predict the trout fish weight, across the years the data was given. 

Our null hypothesis was if the slope resulted in a zero, concluding that we cant predict the trout perch weight given the length. Our alternative hypothesis was if the slope did not result in a zero, than we can conclude that we can predict the trout perch weight given the length. 

We had to filter much of the data but ran two tests, ANOVA and used the summary() function. 

In the end, we rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that when given the length of a trout perch we can predict the weight of the trout perch in the North Temperate Lakes.
